# Image Processing Software
This will be a project where I will implement a software JPG compression algorithm.
Upon implementing a basic software JPG compression algorithm, I will look to 
optimize the efficiency of the algortihm in software and implement a 
DCT and quantization accelerator on a Basys 3 FPGA for hardware
acceleration
